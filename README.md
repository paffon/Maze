# Maze

Maze is a visual demonstration of 3 search algorithms:

### 1. Breadth First Search
BFS is a search algorithm, in which closer places are searched before farther ones get searched.

### 2. Depth First Search
DFS is a search algorithm, in which a chosen path is chosen and searched until a dead-end is reached. Then, previous possible ways are searched.

### 3. A-Star
A-Star uses a heuristic, to determine which places should be searched first.

## How to use?

1. Download the folder, run Main.java (it's inside src folder, duhhh).
2. Tell the system which maze you want to use. You can give it the name of one of the existing mazes (e.g., "maze4" or "smiley", see in the folder). You can also type "random" or leave it empty, which will lead to a randomly generated maze.
3. Tell the system which search algorithm you want: BFS, DFS or AStar. The default is AStar.
